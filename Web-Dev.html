          I First started doing web development during early to mid December
          2022, the thought of creating entire games and website was very
          daunting, so I decided to learn the basics as anyone would for
          learning a new skill.

          The first Programming language I learned was C# for Unity 2D and 3D.
          In Unity I was able to program character movement and mechanics in the
          span of a few weeks, but unfortunately the projects never came into
          fruition as my skills were very under developed.

          Fast Forward to January of 2023 and I try and get my feet wet in the
          Web Development Industry, learning about how website and how the
          internet works, as well as how to build such websites with HTML, CSS,
          and Javascript.

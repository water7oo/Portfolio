I First started doing web development during early to mid December 2022, the thought of creating entire games and website was very daunting, so I decided to learn the basics as anyone would for learning a new skill.

The first Programming language I learned was C# for Unity 2D and 3D. In Unity I was able to program character movement and mechanics in the span of a few weeks, but unfortunately the projects never came into fruition as my skills were very under developed.

Fast Forward to January of 2023 and I try and get my feet wet in the Web Development Industry, learning about how website and how the internet works, as well as how to build such websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
